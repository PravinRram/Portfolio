Moreover, the Sec 2s were going to continue learning Lego Mindstorms. Thus, I opted to join them to get a taste of text-based coding and a new field of IT.</p>

                <p>This learning journey taught me about fields in IT (AR/VR) that I was not very familiar with. I learnt how AR/VR is used in work environments. I saw how robots and automation systems were used to perform tasks in manufacturing with better control, efficiency and quality.I also saw the kinds of advanced manufacturing and remanufacturing technologies that are being developed in the institute.</p>
