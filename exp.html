                <p>Bonding Day was an event that aimed to bring the Sec 2s and 3s closer together as a connected CCA. This activity was one of the activities that we had planned for the day. We wanted to give back to our school so we used our IT skills for the benefit of those in our community. We chose to do video editing as it is simple enough for not tech-savvy people to pick up. The sec 2s and 3s helped the admin staff well while the lesson was ongoing to ensure that they can learn to the best of their abilties. We had pciked up invaluable communication and time management skills from this activity. I am the one who is taking the picture shown here.</p>

We chose to test the CCA members about their knowledge with the EV3 Lego Mindstorms, as it was something that everyone across the levels had a chance to learn. We encouraged members to mix and group up with others they are unfamiliar with during the competition. We had a exciting race to see who could finish the course the EXCO made the fastest, and members worked well with each other to do their best.</p>

                <p>When I went to the leadership workshop by IMDA earlier in the year, I was inspired and taught that we could arrange with the organisations that promoted their services at the workshop to hold a VIA project for all Infocomm members. We decided to do the Tech Saturday programme with VIVITA. Using the skills we learnt from previous CCA sessions, we chose to teach the participants 2 IT skills as there was ample time. Half of the CCA worked on the game development, and the other on robot coding. I was leading the robot coding segment. I worked with my group to come up with a lesson plan that can teach the children about the relevant skills needed to use the EV3 Lego Mindstorms robots. We held a small challenge at the end to test their newfound skills. We had to work very closely with multiple stakeholders to ensure this event was a success.</p>

This competition was not mandatory for the sec 4s, but me and my friends in Infocomm decided to participate so that we could participate in more competitions. However, our CCA would not teaching us about CTF skills, so we had to learn them on our own. We had to motivate and ensure that all of us were on the right track as there was a lot of content to digest before the competition. Nonetheless, we tried our best and managed to capture the flag for several puzzles. The pciture is from the Sieberrsec website, showing that our team (7dot5) got 26th place overall.</p>

                <p>This is another example of the EXCO being able to encourage our Teachers-In-Charge to find vendors that teach more relevant IT skills. We had been coding in block-based for a very long time, and text-based coding is a more useful skill in any IT field. Learning Python is also valuable as it can be used in many IT fields, so members can be exposed to experiences outside of the school environment. We were supposed to learn this in time for another round of the Drone Odyssey Challenge. However, the sec 4s had to step down before we could participate in the competition.</p>
